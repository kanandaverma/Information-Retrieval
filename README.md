# Information-Retrieval
This repository contains a few projects that I did in my Information Retrieval class.

InvertedIndex.java: Implemented Map-Reduce job to create inverted index for a collection of 3,036 English books in Java. Generated a text file which includes the word count for each word and the document id in which it occurs.
